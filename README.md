# Unhandled Exception in MATLAB Function
This repository demonstrates an example of an uncommon code error in MATLAB that is related to unhandled exceptions. The function `myFunction.m` performs different calculations based on the input value. However, it lacks input validation, leading to potential errors such as division by zero when the input is 0. This example highlights the importance of robust input validation and error handling in MATLAB code. The solution demonstrates how to mitigate this problem by implementing input validation and providing alternative logic for problematic input values.
